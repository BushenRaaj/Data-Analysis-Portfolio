## ðŸš€ Projects Overview

### ðŸ§¾ [Project 1 â€“ HR Attrition Data Analysis](./Project_1_HR_Attrition_Analysis)
Analyze employee attrition patterns using HR data to identify key factors influencing turnover.

## ðŸ§® Datasets
| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv` | Raw dataset containing HR-Attrition details |
| `Cleaned_HR_Attrition.xlsx` | Cleaned dataset after preprocessing in Python |
| `Cleaning_Dataset.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook used for data cleaning and transformation |
| `HR_Attrition_Data_Sheet.pbix` | Power BI dashboard file |
---

## ðŸ§± Steps Involved in Building the Project

### 1. Data Collection
- Imported the raw dataset (`WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`) for analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning (Python - Jupyter Notebook)
- Handled missing values, standardized column names, and converted categorical data into dummy variables.  
- Exported the cleaned data to Excel as `Cleaned_HR_Attrition.xlsx`.

### 3. Data Transformation (Power BI)
- Dropped redundant columns including `OverTime_Yes`, `Department_Research & Development`, `JobRole_Manager`, etc.  
- Added calculated columns such as:  
  - **Age Group**, **Salary Band**, **Employee Tenure**, **Risk Score**, and **Risk Category**.  
- Created **DAX measures** for key metrics like:  
  - `Total Employees`, `Avg Monthly Income`, `Attrition Rate`, `Avg Job Satisfaction`, etc.

### 4. Visualization (Power BI Dashboard)
- Designed interactive visuals showing attrition distribution, income vs. tenure, satisfaction vs. performance, etc.  
- Highlighted high-risk groups and key trends using custom KPIs.

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Younger employees and those with lower monthly incomes had higher attrition rates.  
- Employees with poor job satisfaction or limited career growth showed higher attrition risk.  
- The Risk Score model effectively categorized employees into **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** attrition risk levels.

### ðŸ“¦ [Project 2 â€“ E-Commerce Delivery Performance Analysis](./Project_2_ECommerce_Delivery_Performance)
Evaluate delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction through e-commerce data analytics.

## ðŸ§® Datasets
| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Train.csv` | Raw dataset containing e-commerce order details |
| `Cleaned_Train_File.xls` | Cleaned dataset after preprocessing in Python |
| `E-commerce.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook used for data cleaning and transformation |

---

## ðŸ§± Steps Involved in Building the Project

### 1. Data Collection
Imported the raw dataset (`Train.csv`) containing e-commerce order details, shipment modes, warehouses, product costs, discounts, and customer ratings.

### 2. Data Cleaning (Python â€“ Jupyter Notebook)
- Handled missing and inconsistent values.  
- Removed duplicates and standardized categorical fields.  
- Created new columns such as:
  - `Discount_Percent`
  - `Gender_Label`
  - `Weight_Bin`
- Exported the cleaned dataset as **Cleaned_Train_File.xls**.

### 3. Data Transformation (Power BI)
- Imported the cleaned dataset and refined data using **Power Query (M Code)**.  
- Created calculated columns:
  - `Weight_Bin` â€“ Categorized products by weight range.  
  - `Discount_Percent` â€“ Computed discount as a percentage of product cost.  
  - `Gender_Label` â€“ Converted gender codes (M/F) to descriptive labels.  

- Created **DAX measures**:
  - `Total Orders`  
  - `On-Time Deliveries`  
  - `On-Time %`  
  - `Average Discount %`  
  - `Average Rating`  
  - `Average Cost`  
  - `Total Discount Amount`

### 4. Visualization (Power BI Dashboard)
Designed 2â€“3 interactive dashboards focusing on:
- **Delivery Performance** (Shipment mode, warehouse, and trends)  
- **Customer Insights** (Ratings vs. Discounts, Product Importance)  
- **Operational Overview** (On-Time %, Average Discount, Cost KPIs)  

Added **slicers for filters**: Shipment Mode, Warehouse, Product Importance, and Gender.  
Used **KPI cards** and **trend lines** for easy performance tracking.

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Shipments by **Air** had the highest on-time delivery percentage.  
- **Medium-weight products** experienced the most balanced delivery rates and costs.  
- Customers offered **moderate discounts** tended to give higher ratings.  
- Some **warehouses consistently underperformed**, indicating optimization potential.
